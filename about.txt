I built a simple machine learning project that predicts whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on a few everyday habits and background data. 
The idea came from a very common thought we’ve all had: "Will I pass this exam?" or "If a student studies this much is it enough to succeed?" Instead of 
leaving it to guesswork I wanted to train a machine to answer that question using actual data.
The project takes into account factors that are usually important for student success like how many hours a student studies, their class attendance, 
their previous exam scores, how much they sleep and whether or not they take extra tutoring. I manually created a small dataset with this information and
labeled each student as either pass or fail. Using this I trained a logistic regression model which is a simple but powerful algorithm that's great 
for predicting two outcomes like yes or no or pass or fail.
Once the model was trained I tested it with new student data to see how accurately it could make predictions.
For example if I enter that a student studies 4 hours sleeps 6 hours and has 85 percent attendance the model can predict whether that student is likely to pass the exam.
What’s really interesting is watching how the machine starts identifying patterns from the data like students who attend regularly and have had good scores in the past usually end up passing.

Through this project I learned the fundamentals of data preprocessing model training prediction and evaluation.
I also visualized the data using Seaborn to understand how different features are related to the student’s success. This was a fun and eye-opening introduction to machine learning and it made me more confident to explore bigger projects in the future.
